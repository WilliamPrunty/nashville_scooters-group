    "Bird had the greatest number of scooters during this time, with 3757 unique 'sumdid's represented in the data. Gotcha had the lowest number of scooters during this time with 166 scooters represented. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of scooters changed over time, best represented by looking at the 'Unique Scooter IDs by Week' lineplot. Only JUMP had more scooters in service by the end of the data, all others had less scooters at the end of the reporting period. \n",
    "Looking at the above plot, you can see how companies have removed and added scooters through out the timeframe, Bird had the largest addition in one week at an additional ~800 scooters from week 25 to week 26. Bird and Lime share the number one spot for most scooters lost in one week, ~400 during weeks 24/25 and 26/27 respectively. I hypothesize the removal of scooters is due to damage or otherwise loss. The addition of scooters seems to be mostly a matter of 'replacement rate' where only JUMP appears to be actively adding to their fleet size regardless of scooter loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scooter usage clearly varies by company but most likely due to the fleetsize of a given company. Bird has more scooters on the streets, therefore they have more rides represented in the dataset. "
